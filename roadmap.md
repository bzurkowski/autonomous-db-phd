# Roadmap

1. Definition of use cases and requirements for the framework and its components

2. Reference architecture and implementation

3. Autonomous behaviours based on static intelligence (static thresholds, pre-defined strategies)

4. Autonomous behaviours based on ML

5. Containers

6. Multi-site

7. Logs analysis

## Research questions

1. To what extent the cloud infrastructure can support autonomous database management?

    * How it helps in terms of optimization?

    * How it helps in terms of healing?

    * How it helps in terms of configuration?

    * ...

2. Should database solution itself implement autonomous features?

    * How to integrate database autonomy with infrastructure autonommy?

    * Where is the integration boundary? Where are the integration points?

    * What are the benefits of adding autonomy in different domains and infrastructure levels?
